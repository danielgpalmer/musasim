This is for my own failing memory

?_begin	 -- must be called before anything else that must be called as part of a transaction, 
	    usually calls dma_begin to open a DMA transaction

?_?????	 -- functions that must be called after _begin and before _commit for them to work
            correctly. Usually data uploads via DMA. The actual action of the method might
	    not happen until _commit is called. There needs to be some documenta;tion to
	    mark which functions are safe to call outside of a transaction and which aren't. 

?_commit -- flush the current transaction, i.e. commit any DMA transfers.
