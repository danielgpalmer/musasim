What this is;

Current this is the Musashi m68k emulator, source code taken from the latest zip 
I could find on the interwebs, plus all the stuff I could backport from MAME..
The copy of Musashi in MAME now has 040 emulation etc but is pretty MAMEified and
I can't be bothered to work out how to split it back out. I only want 000 emulation
anyhow. On top of that there is a simple simulator (hacked up from the one that was
in the zip) that you can load programs into, a crappy GDB remote protocol 
implementation that you can use to do debugging, and a framebuffer you can write 
to from the m68k side. 

What this will be;

I'm writing this as an emulator for a machine that I'm building.. I want to get the
hardware working nicely in software before I spend a long time writing VHDL and making
it actually work. I am currently expanding the "video hardware" out with a tile based
graphics system. I will add some sound hardware based on blipbuffer at some point too.
